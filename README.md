WhiteBoard
==========

WhiteBoard is and app that helps keep track of ideas.  Strictly in prototype right now.

Currently
=========
* Written with a backbone.js frontend and PHP API backend.
* Consists of "Boards" which are topics for ideas.  Groups of sorts.
* Contributions can be made to each board.
* Attachments can be uploaded when contribution is made.  Uses a hidden iFrame at the moment.
* Attachments can be simply downloaded by clicking on the link.

Future Plans
============

* Possible add a social aspect to share.
* Allow only certain people to contribute to your boards.
* Also public boards which anyone can contribute to.
* Right now users are hardcoded in and can be selected when contributing.
* A login system.
* Determine if attachment can be viewed (PNG, JPG, TXT). If so then display when inflate contribution.
